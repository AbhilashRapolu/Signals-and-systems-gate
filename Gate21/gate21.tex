\textbf{Question 34}:Let $G$ be a group of order $6$, and let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ such that $1 < |H| < 6$. Which one of the following options is correct?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Both $G$ and $H$ are always cyclic.
    \item $G$ may not be cyclic, but $H$ is always cyclic.
    \item $G$ is always cyclic, but $H$ may not be cyclic.
    \item Both $G$ and $H$ may not be cyclic.
\end{enumerate}
\ Solution:
Given: $|G| = 6$

Since $H$ is a subgroup, by Lagrange's theorem:
\[ |H| = 1, 2, 3, \text{ or } 6 \text{ (Divisors of } 6) \]

Now, it is given that $1 < |H| < 6$, so $|H| = 2$ or $3$.

Since $2$ and $3$ are both prime, and every group of prime order is cyclic, $H$ is surely cyclic. However, the order of $|G| = 6$ is not prime.

So, $G$ may or may not be cyclic.

Therefore, $G$ may not be cyclic, but $H$ is always cyclic.
